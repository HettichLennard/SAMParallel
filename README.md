# SAMParallel
Implementation of the SAMParallel t-wise Interaction Sampling Approach in Visual Studio 2022

## Requirements
- A PC with a Windows 11 operating system
- A Nvidia GPU, we suggest at least 4GB of VRAM to execute SAMParallel for larger Software Product Lines (SPL)
- An installation of the Nvidia CUDA Toolkit (https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads), we used Version 12.8 to test SAMParallel
- An installation of the Visual Studio IDE 2022 (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/vs/), the installation has to be done **after** the previous step!
